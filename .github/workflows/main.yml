# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push request
# events for the master branch, and pull request events for all branches.
on:
  push:
    branches: [ master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ '**' ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }} #ubuntu-latest

    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [ubuntu-latest] # [ubuntu-latest, macos-latest] # Run macos tests if really required, since they charge 10 times more for macos
        python-version: [3.6, 3.7, 3.8]

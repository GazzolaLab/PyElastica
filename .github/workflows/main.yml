# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push request
# events for the master branch, and pull request events for all branches.
on:
  push:
    branches: [ master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ '**' ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }} #ubuntu-latest

    strategy:
      matrix:

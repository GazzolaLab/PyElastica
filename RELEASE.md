## Notable Changes
- #70: Knot theory module to compute topological quantities.
- #71: Reorganize rod constructor warning messages and collect messages in log.  
- #72: Muscular snake example is added.

---

# Release Note (version 0.2.2)

## Developer Note

The major documentation update is finished in this version.
Constraint and finalize module are refactored to enhance readability.

## Notable Changes
- #64: Core wrapper redesign. The finalizing code is refactored for easier integration.
- #65: Documentation update.

# Release Note (version 0.2.1)

## Developer Note

Contact model between two different rods and rod with itself is implemented. 
Testing the contact model is done through simulations. These simulation scripts can be found under
[RodContactCase](./RodContactCase). 
However, in future releases we have to add unit tests for contact model functions to test them and increase code coverage.

## Notable Changes
- #31: Merge contact model to master [PR #40 in public](https://github.com/GazzolaLab/PyElastica/pull/40)
- #46: The progress bar can be disabled by passing an argument to `integrate`.
- #48: Experimental modules are added to hold functions that are in test phase.
- 
### Release Note
<details>
  <summary>Click to expand</summary>

- Rod-Rod contact and Rod self contact is added.
- Two example cases for rod-rod contact is added, i.e. two rods colliding to each other in space. 
- Two example cases for rod self contact is added, i.e. plectonemes and solenoids.
- Progress bar can be disabled by passing an argument to `integrate` function.
- Experimental module added.
- Bugfix in callback mechanism

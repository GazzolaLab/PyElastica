# Visualization

## Matplotlib

If you wish to visualize your system, make sure you define your callback function to output all necessary data. You can either plot your data using a python package such as `matplotlib`, or any rendering software that you choose. Note, many of the visualization scripts in the examples folders require [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) (be sure to install with h264 libraries).

## POVray

For high-quality visualization, we suggest [POVray](http://povray.com). See [this tutorial](https://github.com/GazzolaLab/PyElastica/tree/master/examples/Visualization) for examples of different ways of visualizing the system. 

## Rhino

For interactive visualization and rendering, we use [Rhino](https://www.rhino3d.com/) + Grasshopper. See [this extension](https://github.com/skim0119/PyElastica-to-Rhino).

## VTK

The current version does not have VTK-export capability, although we plan to include this feature later.

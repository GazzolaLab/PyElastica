# Visualization

If you wish to visualize your system, make sure you define your callback function to output all necessary data. You can either plot your data using a python package such as `matplotlib`, or any rendering software that you choose. Note, many of the visualization scripts in the examples folders require [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) (be sure to install with h264 libraries).

For high-quality visualization, we suggest [POVray](http://povray.com). See [this tutorial](https://github.com/GazzolaLab/PyElastica/tree/master/examples/Visualization) for examples of different ways of visualizing the system.

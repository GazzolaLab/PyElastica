    "# Timoshenko Beam Example\n",
    "\n",
    "This Elastica tutorial explains the basics of setting up and running a simple simulation of rods in Elastica. Elastica simulates Cosserat Rods, which are thin, 1-dimensional rods that undergo all possible modes of deformation. This example considers a Timoshenko beam, which is the deformation of a beam under a constant applied force while accounting for shear deforation and rotational bending. This is a good example of the capabilities of Elastica and Cosserat Rods as it requires accounting for the effects of shear deformation, something that the classical Euler-Bernoulli beam solution does not.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "To set up the simulation, the first thing you need to do is import the necessary classes. Here we will only import the classes that we need. The `elastica.modules` classes make it easy to construct different simulation systems. Along with these modules, we need to import a rod class, classes for the boundary conditions, and time-stepping functions. As a note, this method of explicitly importing all classes can be a bit cumbersome. Future releases will simplify this step."

This `EndpointForces` applies forces to both ends of the rod. We want to apply a negative force in the $d_1$ direction, but only at the end of the rod. We do this by specifying the force vector to be applied at each end as `origin_force` and `end_force`. We also want to ramp up the force over time, so we make the force take some `ramp_up_time` to reach its steady-state value. This helps avoid numerical errors due to discontinuities in the applied force. "

    "This current method of plotting data during the simulation is helpful for visualizing how the system evolves, but it is computationally inefficient as we are constantly pausing the simulation to plot. It also does not save data for additional post-processing later. A better method for saving data from a simulation is to use call-back functions. There is information on how to use these functions in the [snake tutorial](./2_Slithering_Snake.ipynb)"

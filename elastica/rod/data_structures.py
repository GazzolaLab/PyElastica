        Developer Note
        --------------
        Here the overloaded `+=` operator is exploited to perform
        matrix multiplication for the directors, which is counter-
        intutive at first. While this provides a stable interface
        to interact the rod states with the timesteppers and the
        rest of the world, the reasons behind including it here also has
        a depper mathematical significance.

        Firstly, position lies in the vector space corresponding to R^{3}
        and update is done this space (with the + and * operators defined
        as usual), hence the `+=` operator (or `__iadd__`) is reflected
        as `+=` operator in the position update (line 163 above).

        For directors rather, which lie in a restricteed R^{3} \otimes
        R^{3} tensorial space, the space with Q^T.Q = Q.Q^T = I, the +
        operator can be thought of as an equivalent `*=` update for a
        'exponential' multiplication with a rotation matrix (e^{At}).
        . This does not correspond to the position update. However, if
        we view this in a logarithmic space the `*=` becomse the '+='
        operator once again! After performing this `+=` operation, we
        bring it back into its original space using the exponential
        operator. So we are still indirectly doing the '+='
        update.

        To avoid all this hassle with the operators and spaces, we simply define
        '+=' or '__iadd__' in the case of directors as an equivalent
        '*=' (matrix multiply) with the RHS below.

        Developer Note
        --------------

        Q : Why do we need to overload operators here?

        The Derivative class naturally doesn't have a `mul` overloaded
        operator. That means if this method is not present,
        doing something like
        ```
        ds = _DerivativeState(...)
        new_state = 2 * ds
        ```
        will throw an error. Note that you can do something like
        ```
        ds = _DerivativeState(...)
        new_state = 2 * ds.rate_collection
        ```
        but this is hacky, as we are exposing the members outside,
        in the calling scope (defeats encapsulation and hiding).
        The point of having this class is that it works
        well with the time-stepper (where we only use `+` and `*`
        operations on the State/DerivativeState like above,
        i.e. `state = dt * derivative_state`  and not something like
        `state = dt * derivative_state.rate_collection`).
        It also provides an interface for anything outside
        the `Rod` system as a whole.

    Caveats
    -------
    Takes a np.ndarray and not a _DynamicState object (as one expects).
    This is done for efficiency reasons, see `dynamic_rates`.
    """
    # Always goes in LHS : that means the update is on the rates alone
    # (v,ω) += dt * (dv/dt, dω/dt) ->  self.dynamic_rates
    # rate_collection[..., : n_kinematic_rates] += scaled_second_deriv_array
    blocksize = scaled_second_deriv_array.shape[1]

    for i in range(2):
        for k in range(blocksize):
            rate_collection[i, k] += scaled_second_deriv_array[i, k]

    return
